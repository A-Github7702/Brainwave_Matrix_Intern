 **How It Works**

1. **Time Slots**

   * Generated dynamically using JavaScript.
   * Each slot gets a **unique background color** from a predefined vibrant palette.
   * Clicking on a slot prompts you to enter a task.

2. **Task Management**

   * Tasks are stored in memory while the page is open.
   * Each task has a **status**: `"in progress"` or `"completed"`.
   * Clicking a task toggles its status and updates the stats.

3. **Voice Commands**

   * Uses the **Web Speech API** to capture spoken input.
   * After speaking, the app asks which time slot to assign the task to.

4. **Motivational Images**

   * Rotates through a **set of predefined images** based on the day of the month.
   * If an image fails to load, a fallback placeholder is shown.

5. **Progress Stats**

   * Updates dynamically whenever a task is added or status changes.
   * Shows totals and percentage completion.

**How to Use**

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `day-planner.html` in your browser.
3. **Add tasks** by clicking on any slot or using the microphone button.
4. **Toggle status** by clicking on an existing task.
5. Enjoy **daily motivational quotes** while tracking your progress.
